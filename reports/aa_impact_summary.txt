CLTV model performance (synthetic data):

AUC_base_without_AA = 0.9994
AUC_with_AA_features = 1.0000

Interpretation:
- AA features give a small but positive lift on this synthetic dataset.
- In a real bank dataset, the same setup can show how AA (wallet share, balances, digital usage) improves lead ranking quality.
